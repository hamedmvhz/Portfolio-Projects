## I used V_Orders_Test data base provided in the Intermediate SQL for Data Analysis course on Udemy
## Finding the first Sales Order Id when total sale is more than 300K
drop table if exists #rankkings
;WITH "orders" AS 
(
select 
 SalesOrderID,
  sum(LineTotal) AS TotalValueOrder
from dbo.V_Orders_Test
GROUP BY SalesOrderID
)
select 
  *
into #rankings
from 
  "orders"
;WITH "rankingtotal" AS 
(
select 
  SalesOrderID,
  TotalValueOrder,
  sum(TotalValueOrder) OVER(Order By SalesOrderID) As sum_of_total
from #rankings
)
select 
 Top 1 SalesOrderID,
  min(sum_of_total)
from "rankingtotal"
where sum_of_total > 300000
Group BY 
  SalesOrderID
  
## how many SalesOrderID took t arrive at 300k$ sales
drop table if exists  #ranking
;WITH "Total" AS 
(
SELECT 
  SalesOrderID,
  sum(LineTotal) AS totalsale
from 
  dbo.V_Orders_Test
Group By  
  SalesOrderID
)
SELECT 
  *,
  ROW_NUMBER () OVER(ORDER BY SalesOrderID) AS RN
INTO #ranking
FROM 
  "total"
;WITH "rankedtotal" As 
(
select 
  *,
  sum(totalsale) OVER (Order by SalesOrderID) AS Totalrevenue
from #ranking
)
select 
  min(RN) 
from 
  "rankedtotal"
where 
  Totalrevenue > 300000
